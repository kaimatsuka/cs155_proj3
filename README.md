## How to run code
To train Hidden Markov Model (HMM) without rhyming
1. Run 'code/train_hmm_naive.py'

To train HMM with rhyming 
1. Run 'code/train_hmms.py'
Note that this function trains multiple HMM models for different number of hidden variables.

To train LSTM
1. Run 'jupyter/keras_LSTM_preprocess.ipynb'
1. Run 'jupyter/keras_LSTM_training.ipynb'
1. Run 'jupyter/keras_LSTM_temperature.ipynb'
